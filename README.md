# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project is a simple implementation of face detection using Python and OpenCV.  
It was created to practice working with computer vision, Haar cascades, and Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 📌 About the Project
The idea is straightforward: take input from a webcam or an image, and detect human faces using OpenCV’s built-in cascade classifier.  
I built this as a beginner-friendly project to get more comfortable with OpenCV and real-time video processing.

## ⚙️ Features
- Detects faces in images and video streams  
- Uses Haar Cascade Classifier (frontal face)  
- Works in real time with a webcam  
- Simple and easy to understand code

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/shakyanitish/FaceDetection-using-OPENCV.git
   cd FaceDetection-using-OPENCV
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install opencv-python
   
3. Run the notebook or Python script:

  jupyter notebook Face-detection.ipynb


📷 Demo
When you run the code with your webcam, a window will open showing your face with a rectangle around it.
